      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <h3>Information technology problem</h3>
      <p>As aspiring students venture into the user experience (UX) design industry, 
        they often encounter a scarcity of readily available online information about 
        how to begin their journey. Navigating this industry requires individuals to search 
        through various sources and view others' work for inspiration to fuel their own projects 
        and portfolios. This stressful and time-consuming process can add unnecessary stress and length 
        to their user journey.
