        <h2>Problem Description</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Our final project aims to be a source of inspiration and feedback for people
            aspiring to work in the UX field. When creating a portfolio, it can be overwhelming
            to begin. Our website can be a reference for beginning designers, where people
            can submit their different portfolios to be displayed, and also get feedback on it.

            At a place like UW, where careers in tech, especially in UX/HCI, are in high demand,
            this website can become an important tool to help students get started on creating
            their own portfolios and other projects to kickoff their careers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Information technology problem</h3>
          <p>As aspiring students venture into the user experience (UX) design industry,
          they often encounter a scarcity of readily available online information about
          how to begin their journey. Navigating this industry requires individuals to search
          through various sources and view others' work for inspiration to fuel their own projects
          and portfolios. This stressful and time-consuming process can add unnecessary stress and length
          to their user journey.
          </p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h3>Existing Attempts</h3>
          <p>
            One existing solution is <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a>,
            which is a networking and project sharing
            site for designers. The website lets users share their projects and find
            clients. However, the projects on the website are from established,
            professional designers instead of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another existing solution is resume sharing platforms such as
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.
            LinkedIn helps users find work, but isn't tailored for designers. For
            example, on LinkedIn, there's no easily accessible way to find a user's
            website, and many designers use websites as their portfolio.

      <section>
        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>Users</h3>
          <p>
            The intended users of the website are people who are looking to get into the
            user experience/human computer interaction field, specifically informatics/HCDE/interaction
            design students at UW. However, anyone who wants to learn more about creating a portfolio
            or UX project can benefit from using our website. For first-gen college students, this
            website can significantly help their journey to a career in the field. These resources (portfolios,
            case studies) are tradionally shared amongst already-existing connections, and making it more
            accessible on a public website can be helpful for first-gen students.
          </p>

          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Users will be able to upload their UX design projects to create a
              portfolio within our web app. Each project upload will include pictures
              of the project, a description of the project, date, creator, and other data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users will be able to sort and search through the projects. For example,
              if a potential client is trying to hire a 3rd year HCDE student,
              they'll be able to filter through the designers to find a match.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users will be able to bookmark projects and then create collections of their
              saved projects. This will allow users to collect inspiration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another possible feature is allowing users to message designers on the
              web app. This would let designers to network and find new clients.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Information To Be Viewed</h3>
          <p>Users will be presented with a gallery of different portfolios and projects from other designers at UW.
            Additionally, our web application will include a "Beginner's Guide to UX design" that will allow people
            to learn the UX process on their own. This will be in the form of including UW related resources related
            to UX design or case studies of projects that go in to their UX design process.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Intended Solution</h3>
          <p>
            The final website will serve as a way for students to share their portfolios and
            projects that have been successful in helping them progress their careers in UX. That
            way, students who are just starting off or need more help are able to go on the
            website to get inspiration for their own projects without needing to go through random
            LinkedIn profiles to find portfolios or having to ask around. With this website,
            we hope to make careers in UX more accessible to students of all backgrounds.
