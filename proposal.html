      <h2>Problem Description</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Our final project aims to be a source of inspiration and feedback for people
          aspiring to work in the UX field. When creating a portfolio, it can be overwhelming
          to begin. Our website can be a reference for beginning designers, where people
          can submit their different portfolios to be displayed, and also get feedback on it.

          At a place like UW, where careers in tech, especially in UX/HCI, are in high demand,
          this website can become an important tool to help students get started on creating
          their own portfolios and other projects to kickoff their careers.

        <h3>Existing Attempts</h3>
        <p>
          One existing solution is Behance, which is a networking and project sharing
          site for designers. The website lets users share their projects and find
          clients. However, the projects on the website are from established,
          professional designers instead of students.

          Another existing solution is resume sharing platforms such as LinkedIn.
          LinkedIn helps users find work, but isn't tailored for designers. For
          example, on LinkedIn, there's no easily accessible way to find a user's
          website, and many designers use websites as their portfolio.

      <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Users will be able to upload their UX design projects to create a
            portfolio within our web app. Each project upload will include pictures
            of the project, a description of the project, date, creator, and other data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users will be able to sort and search through the projects. For example,
            if a potential client is trying to hire a 3rd year HCDE student,
            they'll be able to filter through the designers to find a match.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users will be able to bookmark projects and then create collections of their
            saved projects. This will allow users to collect inspiration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another possible feature is allowing users to message designers on the
            web app. This would let designers to network and find new clients.
          </li>
