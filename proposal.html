      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <h3>Information technology problem</h3>
      <p>As aspiring students venture into the user experience (UX) design industry, 
        they often encounter a scarcity of readily available online information about 
        how to begin their journey. Navigating this industry requires individuals to search 
        through various sources and view others' work for inspiration to fuel their own projects 
        and portfolios. This stressful and time-consuming process can add unnecessary stress and length 
        to their user journey.

        <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Our final project aims to be a source of inspiration and feedback for people 
          aspiring to work in the UX field. When creating a portfolio, it can be overwhelming 
          to begin. Our website can be a reference for beginning designers, where people 
          can submit their different portfolios to be displayed, and also get feedback on it. 
          
          At a place like UW, where careers in tech, especially in UX/HCI, are in high demand, 
          this website can become an important tool to help students get started on creating 
          their own portfolios and other projects to kickoff their careers.

        <h3>Existing Attempts</h3>
        <p>
          One existing solution is Behance, which is a networking and project sharing
          site for designers. The website lets users share their projects and find
          clients. However, the projects on the website are from established,
          professional designers instead of students.

          Another existing solution is resume sharing platforms such as LinkedIn.
          LinkedIn helps users find work, but isn't tailored for designers. For
          example, on LinkedIn, there's no easily accessible way to find a user's
          website, and many designers use websites as their portfolio.
