        <h3>Existing Attempts</h3>
        <p>
          One existing solution is Behance, which is a networking and project sharing
          site for designers. The website lets users share their projects and find
          clients.

          Another existing solution is resume sharing platforms such as LinkedIn and Read.cv.
          These websites help users find work, but aren't tailored to helping designers. For
          example, on LinkedIn, there's no easily accessible way to find a user's personal
          website, and many designers use websites as their portfolio.
